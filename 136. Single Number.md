Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

```c++
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
	int res = 0;
	for(int index=0; index != nums.size(); index++){
		res ^= nums[index];
	}     
	return res;
}
```
